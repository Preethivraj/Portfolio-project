# Portfolio-project
ðŸŒŸ Excited to share that Iâ€™ve successfully completed my Portfolio Page project as part of my Oasis Infobyte internship!

This project was a fantastic opportunity to put my web development skills into practice. As a student, I got hands-on experience in:

Writing clean and structured HTML & CSS to create a visually appealing layout.

Designing a responsive interface that works seamlessly across devices.

Organizing content effectively to ensure a smooth user experience.

Working on this portfolio page helped me understand the importance of combining design and functionality, and it gave me a real sense of how projects are developed in a professional environment.

Iâ€™m really looking forward to building more projects that challenge me, help me grow, and expand my web development skills. ðŸš€
